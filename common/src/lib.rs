/// a few times, mostly during initialization, and thus inlining it would serve little purpose other
/// than increasing binary size.

/// Note2: we do not use `libc::getenv` because the long-term plan is not depending on `libc` in
/// the `daemon` (currently we can only do that in Rust nightly).
///
/// Note3: the `env` parameter must **NOT** end with an `=` byte (before the final null byte,
/// of course), as environment entries are matched by looking for `env` followed immediately by `=`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `environ` must be a valid array of null-terminated strings.
